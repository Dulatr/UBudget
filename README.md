# UBudget 

A small UWP application using `LiteDB` and `OxyPlot`.

Tracks account values, income and transactions. Users can track transaction types accross accounts to show how much they are spending on certain categories.
It features the ability to project net account values assuming transaction category spending remains roughly the same month to month.

### About

This was a personal project that I started in light of some of my own monthly handling of spreadsheets. It's a learning experience of UWP and databases that I wanted to do, but if anyone else comes across and learns anything from it I would be happy. It's in no way a polished application but I've started a new project where I'm starting to learn SQL queries and the MVVM pattern. My friend with the github handle PoodleSlayer really gave me some helpfully suggestions while in PR's that I wanted to keep as a future resource.
