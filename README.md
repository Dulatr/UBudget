# UBudget 

A small UWP application using `LiteDB` and `OxyPlot`.

Tracks account values, income and transactions. Users can track transaction types accross accounts to show how much they are spending on certain categories.
It features the ability to project net account values assuming transaction category spending remains roughly the same month to month.
